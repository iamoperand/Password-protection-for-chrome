## Password protection for chrome
This repository started its journey as a clone of the original Passbrow extension available in the Chrome App store.  
Although the original extension was a step in the right direction, there are several features which I found missing and this led to the eventual removal of the extension.  
Here are some of these features / bugs:  
- It asks for the password on opening every new window. This is redundant and frustrating.  
- It doesn't allow guest user or other users to operate chrome, asks for password instead. They didn't install the extension, I did. Why should they be shown the password popup?  
- It is not synchronized across devices.  
  
These are the features / bugs that this repository aims to provide / fix.  
  
## Contribution Requirements:  
- You should have a good grasp of Javascript.
